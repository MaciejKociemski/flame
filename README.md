# flame

The "flame" application is an interactive animation of flames, created using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS, resulting in a visual effect that resembles realistic flames of fire.

## 
1. Canvas HTML5: The application uses the canvas element to draw and render animations. Canvas allows the manipulation of pixels on the screen, which is ideal for animating visual effects.

2. Flame Animation: Using a flame animation algorithm, the app generates a fire effect that resembles flames floating on a surface. The algorithm updates the color intensity of pixels based on neighboring pixels, which creates a dynamic burning fire effect.

3. JavaScript: The application is written in JavaScript, which is used to manipulate data and interact with page elements. The JavaScript scripts control the generation of random values for the flames, updating their state and rendering on the canvas.

4. CSS: Styling of the application is accomplished using a CSS stylesheet. In your CSS code, we notice variables such as the height and width of the flames, allowing you to flexibly customize the appearance of your app.
